# JavaScript-Interactive-Photo-Gallery
In this assignment you will use the code that I provide in order to create an interactive photo gallery.  The goal is to gain practice with writing JavaScript code to update elements of the DOM. You will fill in the code for two functions â€“ one to respond to when a mouse is over an image, and the other to respond to when the mouse leaves an image. 

Your peer review is a learning experience as well since it will allow you to see how your peer's code may differ from yours, while still achieving the same objectives.
